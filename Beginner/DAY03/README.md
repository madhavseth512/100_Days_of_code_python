# Day 03

### Today we have learnt about the following topics in Python

- If else conditional statement 
- if-elif-else conditional statement
- Conditional Operators
- Logical operators and what is the syntax to write them
- Using triple quotes to write string in multiple lines
- About variable_name.lower() function to convert the string into lower case
- And similarly variable_name.upper() to convert the string to upper case
- About variable_name.count() to count a particular character/string in the string 
```python
# Example of string counting, we can also count a particular character
greetings = "hello world hello hello hello"
count = greetings.count("hello")
print(count)
# Here the output would be 4 
```
