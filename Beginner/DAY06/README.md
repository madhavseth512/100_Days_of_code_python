# Day 06

### What we have learnt today ?

- We have learnt how to define functions, what is the syntax of creating functions 
- How to use while loops and what are its syntax in Python language 
- About indentation. Spaces vs Tabs !!!

I prefer to use tabs because we do not have to repeatedly press the space-bar key as I find it time-consuming.
