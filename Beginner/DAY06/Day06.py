# Functions
# There are many in built functions in python that we are using till now like len(), round(), int() etc

# We can create our own custom functions:
def my_function():
    print("hello")
    print("cuties")


# Calling the functions to execute the lines of code in it
my_function()

# Indentation is very important in the function also. Same indentation means it belongs to the same block of code

# WHILE LOOP SYNTAX
number = 6
while number > 0:
    print("Testing while loop")
    number -= 1

print("Now we are out of while loop")
